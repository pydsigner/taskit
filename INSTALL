To install (as root):

    $ python setup.py

If you are using Ubuntu you may need to install python*-dev.

To distribute with your application, simply copy the taskit/ tree into the 
main dir of your application.

You may wish to do this for two reasons:

1) Not everyone has TaskIt installed, therefore if you ship it, your users 
   won't have to install it themselves.

2) Shipping TaskIt locks in features and locks out new bugs.
